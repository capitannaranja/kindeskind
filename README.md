# Kindeskind
Kindeskind is a CROSS GENERATION MESSENGER that aims for connecting generations by enabling elderly people to communicate with their younger relatives using a voice interface. [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) messages can easily be send and received by means of an *Amazon Alexa* Skill (on an *Amazon Echo* or an *Alexa-enabled device*). Smart *Philips Hue* lights are used as optical signal for newly received ones.
